"Check If Empty" Plan Post-Test #4 - Match labels to code
=========================================================

Use what you've learned about the "Check if Empty" plan to solve the problem below.

I am creating a course roster for my class. A course roster is made up of students.

My goal is to **determine if the course roster entered by the user is empty before saving the roster**.

.. reveal:: contextbox_C4_clicklabel
    :showtitle: Learn more about code for course rosters
    :hidetitle: Hide information about code for course rosters

    A course roster contains students.

    There are several ways to get a course roster::

       getCourseRoster("Put course name here")
       enterCourseRoster()

    You can get the number of students in the roster::

	length(roster)

    Each student has its own:
	*Final Score* – from 0-100::
		
		getFinalScore(student)
		setFinalScore(student, newFinalScore)

	*Attendance Points* – points for participating in class::

		getAttendancePoints(student)
		setAttendancePoints(student, newAttendancePoints)

	*Extra Credit* – number of extra credit points::

		getExtraCredit(student)
		setExtraCredit(student, newExtraCredit)

    There are several things you can do with a course roster::

        save(roster)
	showGradeDistribution(roster)
	getHighestGrade(roster)
	dropAbsentStudents(roster)

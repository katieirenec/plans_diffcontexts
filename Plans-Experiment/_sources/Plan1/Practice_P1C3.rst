"Check If Empty" Plan - Practice #3
=============================================

Sometimes, we want to **determine if an input is empty before we do something with it**. 
When we want to achieve a goal of this type, we use the "Check if Empty" plan.

Please complete this practice problem before moving on. You may look at the example on the previous page.

    In this practice problem, your goal is to **determine if the profile picture from the webcam is empty before displaying the picture**.

       if length(profile_picture) == 0:
       =====
           error("Picture is empty!")
       =====
       else:
       =====
           display(profile_picture)
       =====
       picture = pickPicture() #distractor
       =====
       if length(picture) >= 1: #distractor
       =====
       print("Webcam isn't working") #distractor
